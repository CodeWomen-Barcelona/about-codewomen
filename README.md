This repository is used for the projects that are created for the :muscle: CodeWomen :computer: coding sessions.

For each project, we aim to have different levels: for starters, for students, and for graduates. What do we mean by these levels?
* ðŸ’» starters: the student has learned HTML and CSS, possibly started learning JavaScript
* ðŸ’» ðŸ’» students (also called 'more advanced'): the student has learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript, possibly also React
* ðŸ’» ðŸ’» ðŸ’» graduates: students have finished a bootcamp or have been self-learning all the above plus Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL
**Note:** these are very general indications, in line with the curriculum that the students of MigraCode follow. CodeWomen offers a safe and open environment where learning at any level is encouraged. There are coaches to help, and anyone can try a project at any level they want!

In the README docs, the challenges for the three levels are explained. All CodeWomen can work on any and every level of these projects they want. As always in programming, there are various ways to build the projects. We will upload some of the possible solutions for every project once the CodeWomen group has worked on the project.


## Please note:
If you want to download this code on your local machine, do not fork it but clone the repo and then create a new repo to use in your own GitHub account. Why should you clone and not fork? It will show the project as **your own project** and not a fork of someone else's project. You can use it as a project for your portfolio.

You can connect a local project to a new, empty GitHub repo [as follows](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line). We can do this together during a CodeWomen coding session: it is very good to know this so that you can start a project locally and afterwards link it with a remote GitHub repo.

If you clone and do not fork the project, you will have to change the 'remote origin' repository after cloning. Check the remote of your local project_advice_generator project using `git remote -v`. You will probably see:  
`origin  https://github.com/CodeWomen-Barcelona/some-codewomen-project.git (fetch)`  
`origin  https://github.com/CodeWomen-Barcelona/some-codewomen-project.git (push)`

To link your local project to your own GitHub repo, you need to change the remote origin. Have a look at this article: https://devconnected.com/how-to-change-git-remote-origin/. With `git remote -v` you can again check if remote origin has been reset and now shows the name of your GitHub account.

PS: if you work for a company that has a corporate social responsibility policy and wants to support women in tech, then here is the link to the [fundraising overview of MigraCode](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zs-Mmi39bcjVw2U-iEQWSHSjkb-EmET-j1WB2oJF45Q/edit#gid=0).

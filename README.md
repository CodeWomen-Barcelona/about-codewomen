This repository is used for the projects that are created for the :muscle: CodeWomen :computer: coding sessions.

For each project, we aim to have different levels: for starters, for students, and for graduates. In the README docs these levels are explained. All CodeWomen can work on any and every level of these projects. As always in programming, there are various ways to build the projects. We will upload some of the possible solutions for every project once the CodeWomen group has worked on the project.


## Please note:
If you want to download this code on your local machine, do not fork it but clone the repo and then create a new repo to use in your own GitHub account, so that it is your own project and not a fork of this project. You can connect a local project to a new, empty GitHub repo [as follows](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line). We can do this together during the coding session: it is very good to know this so that you can start a project locally and later on link it with a remote GitHub repo.

If you clone and do not fork the project, you will have to change the 'remote origin' repository after cloning. Check the remote of your local project_advice_generator project using `git remote -v`. You will probably see:  
`origin  https://github.com/CodeWomen-Barcelona/some-codewomen-project.git (fetch)`  
`origin  https://github.com/CodeWomen-Barcelona/some-codewomen-project.git (push)`

To link your local project to your own GitHub repo, you need to change the remote origin. Have a look at this article: https://devconnected.com/how-to-change-git-remote-origin/. With `git remote -v` you can again check if remote origin has been reset and now shows the name of your GitHub repo.

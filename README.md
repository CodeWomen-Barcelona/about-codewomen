# TechFems is your new tribe! (replacing CodeWomen)
The [TechFems](https://techfems.org/) initiative brings together women+ from various tech fields: data analysis, UX/UI design, software development, product management, tech recruitment, game development, blockchain, machine learning, and more. What brings all these professional women+ together is the drive to build a community where women+ can learn together, meet other women to build a network, and support each other. TechFems is providing a safe space for women+ to empower each other. In a sector where women+ are by far the minority, TechFems offers a warm welcome and a supportive community, full of learning, networking, and social activities. Follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/techfems) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/techfems.barcelona). Our community is for women+, by women+. If you are a woman(-identifying) in tech or aspiring a career in tech, join our [Slack](https://communityinviter.com/apps/techfems/techfems).

This repository is used for the projects that are created for women who want to code and need inspiration for a project.

For each project, there are different levels: for starters, for students, and for graduates. What do we mean by these levels?
* ðŸ’» starters: the student has learned HTML and CSS, possibly started learning JavaScript
* ðŸ’» ðŸ’» students (also called 'more advanced'): the student has learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript, possibly also React
* ðŸ’» ðŸ’» ðŸ’» graduates: students have finished a bootcamp or have been self-learning all the above plus Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL  

In the README docs, the challenges for the three levels are explained. You can work on any and every level of these projects they want. As always in programming, there are various ways to build the projects.

## Please note:
If you want to download a project on your local machine, do not fork it but clone the repo locally, on your computer. After that, create a new repo in your own GitHub account *with exactly the same project name*, and link the local repo to the remote repo in your GitHub account (see below). Why should you clone and not fork? It will show the project as **your own project** and not a fork of someone else's project. You can use it as a project for your portfolio.

You can connect a local project to a new, empty GitHub repo [as follows](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line). 

To link your local project to your own GitHub repo, you need to change the remote origin. Have a look at this article: https://devconnected.com/how-to-change-git-remote-origin/. With `git remote -v` you can again check if remote origin has been reset and now shows the name of your GitHub account.
